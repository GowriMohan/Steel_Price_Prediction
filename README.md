# Steel_Price_Prediction

The dataset represents steel items available to customers. Each row represents an item and includes its offered/selling price.
• Analyzed all features using statistical and visualisation methods (used techniques like data summarization, correlation, data cleaning, feature engineering, etc) and prepared the data for a regression model.
• Divided the data into 90:10 training and testing sets, respectively. Created multiple regression models to predict an item's price (At least 4 models).
• Fine-tuned the best regression model's hyperparameters.
• On the testing set, evaluated the best model using the metric r2 score.

Also created a detailed report to document my work to showcase the analysis, visualizations, results, findings, etc.
