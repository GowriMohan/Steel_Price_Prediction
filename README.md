# Steel_Price_Prediction

The dataset represents steel items available to customers. Each row represents an item and includes its offered/selling price.

1. Analyzed all features using statistical and visualisation methods (used techniques like data summarization, correlation, data cleaning, feature engineering, etc) and prepared the data for a regression model.
2. Divided the data into 90:10 training and testing sets, respectively. Created multiple regression models to predict an item's price (At least 4 models).
3. Fine-tuned the best regression model's hyperparameters.
4. On the testing set, evaluated the best model using the metric r2 score.
5. Also created a detailed report to document my work to showcase the analysis, visualizations, results, findings, etc.
